# Module Fourteen Challenge Report

# Overview of The Project
---

In this analysis, Pandas will be used to hange the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, a set of visualizations will be generated to: 
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

So that they will be used later on to pitch the investors.
