# Module Fourteen Challenge Report

## Overview of The Project
---

In this analysis, Pandas will be used to hange the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, a set of visualizations will be generated to: 
- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

So that they will be used later on to pitch the investors.

In addition to that, significant need for bikes is during weekdays |

## Summary
To summarize, these points can be deduced from the above table :
- The majority of users are males.
- The usage of bikes is in high demand when people go to and leave work during the week days.
- One time users don't use bike often as subscribed ones. 

These two visualizations can be added, each one will be for the start and end location name, with their longitude and latitute to identify loaction on a map with marker size varying based on the count of riders.
